BUGS:

- after stopping audio and then restarting, sometimes get a chunk of white noise
  before audio plays normally - seems like its coming from drum synthesizer, but
  not 100% sure about that. (dividing by a very small number? something to do w/
  fm?)


FEATURES:

- sample selection ui with preset samples (use a modal, user can chose existing
  sample that is already part of song, chose to load a preset one, or chose to
  upload a new one)

- better handling of allocation of objects containing mutable state for tracks
  and instruments when they are added or removed - song should do this as part
  of update method instead of tracks doing it for themselves in `tick`.. it can
  compare old against new tracks to see what has changed

- better cleanup in cursor cache

- webrtc collaboration (and ui for it)

- add fm synth

- add velocity to notes, piano roll

- rethink ui: add live style clip view? add logic style arrange view?

- piano roll
  - when a note is placed on top of another note they should merge
  - show loop size like ableton, make view size independtent of loop size, make
    dragging notes expand view size
  - try to reproduce / fix bug where option key is stuck on
  - try to reproduce / fix bug where cursor gets stuck
  - copy / paste

- renamable tracks and items in list view

- add swing to grid in piano roll

- add 'off' to quantization options

- WRITE UNIT TESTS for dsp / midi stuff - try to figure out a good way to test
  interprocess communication

- add instrument keyMap() function to drum sampler and loop sampler, pass to
  piano roll to display rows only for mapped drums (piano roll has toggle button
  for this, if this is not available piano roll has 2 selects to choose root
  note and scale, can fold into those)

- automation
  - velocity
  - make some standard way to have props on models calculated including
    automation / midi
  - add automation ui.. experiment w/ sweep / lfo generators.  this is an area
    where this room for improvement over ableton

- add loop slicing sampler
  - global pitch / volume envelope
  - global filter
  - waveform slicing ui w/ zoom

- update analog synth
  - mappable lfo

- plugin format for instruments and effects + plugin import from github

- effects
  - add effects busses
  - add insert effects
  - reverb

  - delay

  - compression (w/ sidechain)
  - distortion

- Ryan's Comments
  - play button next to sample
  - arrow or improved design on sample start
  - magnifying glass on hover over waveform to show drag to zoom
  - move root note and start controls to under sample
  - put LFO controls under filter
  - waveform should be mirrored
  - anlog synth left to right order oscillator, filter, envelope
  - able to share a link w/ song state instead of download
  - when you try to record or upload samples
    - default samples
      - two kits: edm, hip hop
